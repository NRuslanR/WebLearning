		In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies 
		to a shared mainline several times a day.
		Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method,
		although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. 
		Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day â€“ perhaps as many as tens of times per day
