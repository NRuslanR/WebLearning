				Wi-Fi is a family of wireless network protocols, based on the IEEE 802.11 family of 
				standards, which are commonly used for local area networking of devices and Internet access. 
				Wi-Fi is a trademark of the non-profit Wi-Fi Alliance, 
				which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that successfully complete 
				interoperability certification testing. As of 2010, 
				the Wi-Fi Alliance consisted of more than 375 companies from around the world. 
				As of 2009, Wi-Fi-integrated circuit chips shipped approximately 580 million units yearly.
				Devices that can use Wi-Fi technologies include desktops and laptops, smartphones and tablets, 
				smart TVs, printers, digital audio players, digital cameras, cars and drones.

				Automation, or Labor-saving technology is the technology by which a process or procedure 
				is performed with minimal human assistance.
				Automation
				or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, 
				processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, 
				steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention.

				A domain is the target subject of a computer program. It is a term used in software engineering. 
				Formally it represents the target subject of a specific programming project, 
				whether narrowly or broadly defined.
				For example, a particular programming project might have had as a goal 
				the creation of a program for a particular hospital, and that hospital would be the domain. 
				Or the project could be expanded in scope to include all hospitals as their domain.
				In a computer programming design, you define a domain by delineating a set of common requirements, 
				terminology, and functionality for any software program constructed to solve a problem in 
				the area of computer programming, known as domain engineering. The word domain is also taken as a synonym of application domain.
