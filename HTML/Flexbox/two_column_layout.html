			AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by 
			Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges 
			encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and 
			the testing of such applications by providing a framework for 
			client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, 
			along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

			AngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, 
			Express.js web application server framework, Angular.js itself, and Node.js server runtime environment. 
			Version 1.7.x is on Long Term Support until July 1st 2021. After that date 
			AngularJS will no longer be updated and Angular (2.0+) is suggested instead

			Redis popularized the idea of a system that can be considered 
			at the same time a store and a cache, using a design where data is 
			always modified and read from the main computer memory, but also stored on 
			disk in a format that is unsuitable for random access of data, 
			but only to reconstruct the data back in memory once the system restarts. 
			At the same time, Redis provides a data model that is very unusual compared 
			to a relational database management system (RDBMS). User commands do 
			not describe a query to be executed by the database engine but rather specific 
			operations that are performed on given abstract data types. Hence, data must 
			be stored in a way which is suitable later for fast retrieval, without help 
			from the database system in form of secondary indexes, aggregations or other common features 
			of traditional RDBMS. The Redis implementation makes heavy use of the fork system call, 
			to duplicate the process holding the data, so that the parent process continues to serve clients, 
			while the child process creates a copy of the data on disk.

			Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. 
			It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. 
			Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.
			Redux is a small library with a simple, limited API designed to be a predictable container for application state. 
			It operates in a similar fashion to a reducing function, a functional programming concept.
			It is influenced by the functional programming language Elm
